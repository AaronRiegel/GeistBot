# GeistBot

### What is it?

A discord bot I'm working on.

### How to use

A the current moment you will need to setup your own discord api access

* https://discord.com/developers/applications
* https://discord.js.org/#/

Or follow this guide: https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot

I have `npm start` setup to run the application with nodemon so changes will be auto-reloaded.
